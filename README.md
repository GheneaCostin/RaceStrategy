-  **Manual & AI Pit Stop Strategy**
  - Assign pit stop laps manually or use a placeholder AI strategy.
  - Supports multi-stint tires with automatic tire switching.
-  **Monte Carlo Simulation**
  - Run the same race multiple times to see variability in lap times and total race time.
-  **Realistic Race Dynamics**
  - Lap times affected by tire wear, fuel load, weather, and track.
  - Pit stop times include small random variability.
  - Random lap time noise Â±0.5% to simulate real-world unpredictability.
-  **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**
  - Select track, weather, tire compounds, fuel load, total laps, and number of simulation runs.
  - Visualize **lap times, tire wear, and fuel level** with interactive Plotly charts.
  - Pit stops clearly marked on charts.
